CCA URL Shorten & Redirect allows you to use another website as a URL shortener and create custom redirections remotely.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to use another website as a URL shortener and create custom redirections. Install this plugin on the website where you want to control the short links from (example.com). Host plugin must be installed on the other website (e.g. exm.pl).

== How to Use ==

1. Install the plugin on website 1 (host).
2. On the Plugins page, active and click on the Settings links for the host plugin.
3. Select "As the client website" and save changes.
4. Type in client website URL without a trailing slash "/" and choose an API Secret Key, save changes. 
5. Install the plugin on the website 2 (client).
6. Select "As the host website" and save changes.
7. Type in host website URL without a trailing slash "/" and type in the API Secret Key you chose earlier, save changes.
8. Now you can type a shortlink and a target address on this page (client settings page) and the redirections will be done on the host website.
